programming pearls exercises in Go.

This started with me learning Go and has (d)evolved into a smattering of packages that are loosely connected. It's been very fun for a lot of reasons, but there's no real attempts at great engineering practices. Mostly just being overly verbose, or repeating myself too much for the sake of learning/jumping around. Peruse at your own risk :).

Most sections are driven by tests, which likely also include benchmarks. The test setup for column 1 is especially rough because I thought I'd be clever about meta testing and made some poor calls. Like I said, a lot of the stuff is me hopping around with ideas, and focusing on the programming pearl lesson.
